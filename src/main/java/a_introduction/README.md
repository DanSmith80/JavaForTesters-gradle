# Introduction to Java

## Simple variables

### Task 1

In class `Task1` create variables with types:
- int a 
- char b 
- double c
- long d
- bool e

Set them to proper values.


### Task 2
In `Task2` create another variable 
- `int magic` and set it's value to 2147483647.
- add one to it 

What happened?

### Task 3
```java
double y = 0.1;
double z = 0.2;
bool areEquals = y + z == 0.3;
```
 
Is `0.1 + 0.2` equal `0.3` (in Java)?

### Task 4
Print out in console:
`Tester was "super" excited due to the developer notoriously ignoring bug reports`
(watch out for quotes inside the string)

## Conditionals 
### Task 5
Create two variables:
- string name
- int age

Print a string in the format "Name, is X years old and is (under)age" depending on whether the age variable is less than 18 or not.

Hint: Use name and age variables and string interpolation for this.
