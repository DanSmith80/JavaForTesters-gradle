#### Excercise 1
1. Run the program in the `OurExceptions.cs` class
2. Why the inscription `And this should be printed regardless of everything` was not printed?
3. Without changing the value of `b` or the calculations of the variable `c`, correct the program so that the above string is printed.


#### Exercise 2
1. Enter the class `ThrowExceptions.cs` and see the application code
2. Correct the `getMaxElement()` method so that it *throws* an `ArgumentException` if the length of the array passed as a parameter is 0 (the array is empty)
3. Correct the code of the `main()` method so that the application starts and prints information about the empty array passed as a parameter.
